Welcome to openLOWDIN Quantum Chemistry Package.

Installation notes.
=============

### Prerequisites: ###

* A standard FORTRAN compiler. gfortran and intel FORTRAN compiler have been tested.
* Lapack or MKL libraries.
* Arpack library.
* [LIBINT library version 1.1.5](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/v1-releases/). NOTE: After download LIBINT please compile with default options. If you want to compile with angular momentum higher than `f`	you should compile LIBINT properly and edit the file `src/ints/LibintInterface.f90` accordingly.

NOTE: If you have the libraries in your own path please be sure to export the LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. ie:

`export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:[your library path]`

### Compile: ###

* run `./configure` in LOWDIN root directory. Be sure that you have permissions to write in the installation directory and have properly exported the `$PATH` environment.

* run `make`

`# apt-get install doxygen graphviz`

To use latex documentation in doc/latex folder, run command:

`pdflatex refman.tex`
