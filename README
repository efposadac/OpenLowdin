Welcome to LOWDIN Quantum Chemistry Package 2.0.

Instalation notes.
==================

1. Prerequisites:

   1.1. A standard FORTRAN compiler. gfortran and intel FORTRAN compiler have been tested.
   1.2. Lapack or mkl libraries. 
   1.3. LIBINT library version 1.1.5. you can download it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/v1-releases/.
        After download LIBINT please compile with default options. If you want to compile LOWDIN with angular momentum higher than "f" 
	you have to compile LIBINT properly and edit the file src/ints/LibintInterface.f90 in order to adjust the arrays size.

   NOTE: If you have the libraries in your own path please be sure to export the LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. ie:
   	 
	 export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:[your library path]
   	 

2. Compile:

   2.1. run ./configure located in the LOWDIN root directory.
        Be sure that you have permissions to write in the instalation directory and properly exported to PATH enviroment variable.

   2.2. run make

3. Install:

   3.1 run make install

4. Uninstall

   4.1 run make uninstall

5. Documentation

   5.1 run make doc
   
   That command produces booth latex and html documentation by using doxygen program. Be sure that you have instaled doxygen program
   for example in a debian-based distribution: 

   #apt-get install doxygen graphviz

   For use latex documentation in doc/latex folder, run command:

   pdflatex refman.tex

   To visualize the html documentation use:

   google-chrome doc/html/index.html

6. Clean the proyect 

   6.1 run make clean and then make distclean
